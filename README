## Requirements
- PHP 7.4 or higher
- Composer
- MongoDB (local or remote)
- Web server (Apache, Nginx, etc.)
- Node.js and npm (optional, for frontend packages)

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Composer installed. Run the following command to install the PHP dependencies:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

## Setup MongoDB
### Download MongoDB
1. **Visit the [MongoDB Download Center](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)**.
2. Choose the version suitable for your operating system and follow the installation instructions.

### Set up MongoDB
1. **Start MongoDB**:
   Open a terminal and run the following command:
   ```bash
   mongod
   ```
   By default, MongoDB runs on port 27017.

2. **Create the database**:
   You can create the `auctionDB` database and collections manually using MongoDB Compass or use the application to populate it automatically.

## Project Setup
1. **Configure Database Connection**:
   Update the `src/config/database.php` file if necessary:
   ```php
   $client = new MongoDB\Client("mongodb://localhost:27017");
   $db = $client->selectDatabase("auctionDB");
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment Variables** (if applicable):
   You can set up an `.env` file to manage sensitive information like database credentials.

## Running the Application
1. **Start a local server**:
   You can use PHP's built-in server for testing:
   ```bash
   php -S localhost:8000 -t public
   ```

2. **Access the application**:
   Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` to view the auction site.

## Usage
- Use the dropdown to select categories and view active auctions.
- Place bids directly on the auction items.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure MongoDB is running and accessible.
- Check for PHP errors in the server logs if the application doesn't load.
