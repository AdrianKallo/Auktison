   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Composer installed. Run the following command to install the PHP dependencies:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

## Setup MongoDB
### Download MongoDB
1. **Visit the [MongoDB Download Center](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)**.
2. Choose the version suitable for your operating system and follow the installation instructions.

### Set up MongoDB
1. **Create the database**:
   After you downloaded the 'MongoDB' open 'MongoDB Compass' and run 
    ```bash
   php db/setup.php
   ```
   It should create the collections there

## Running the Application
1. **Start a local server**:
   You can use PHP's built-in server for testing:
   ```bash
   composer start
   ```
   If you getting error check 'Troubleshooting' part.

2. **Access the application**:
   Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` to view the auction site.

## Usage
- Use the dropdown to select categories and view active auctions.
- Place bids directly on the auction items.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure MongoDB is running and accessible.
- Check for PHP errors in the server logs if the application doesn't load.
- Probably need to add mongoDB to php.ini (See php.ini faili l√µppu: "extension=php_mongodb.dll")
- If still broken intall DDL from here and place it in C:\php\ext 'https://pecl.php.net/package/mongodb'
Version 1.19.0 should do the work.
